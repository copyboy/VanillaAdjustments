Vanilla Adjustments
===================

Hello there. You seem lost. Were you trying to find a place where you could find
information on this mod? Sorry about that, we're silly, just trying to have fun working
on this beautiful piece of art. Of course you're in the right place.

Feel free to contribute, just make sure that you talk to us (oitjustjose and copygirl)
first to make sure we want to accept the changes you're suggesting. The best way to
contact us is in [#obsidian on EsperNet](http://irc.esper.net/#obsidian). And don't
forget the most important thing of all: Your commit messages have to be silly, funny, or
failing to be so.


'Adjustments'
-------------

The mod is going through a change from being one that mostly contains changes that
reflect what I want to see changed in Vanilla Minecraft to being highly configurable.

Since we're going for adjustments to the vanilla Minecraft game, we won't add new items.  

- Adjust the time items dropped from player deaths stay (30 minutes by default)
- Change how natural regeneration works
- Disable any recipes you don't like
- Add reverse recipes for any items (slab, stair and fence by default)
- Replace stuff in some recipes (cobble -> smoothstone by default)

Here are some things that are currently in but will be replaced by more configurable
options in the future, if possible:

- Wood and stone tools straight-up have more durability
- Iron and diamond pickaxes have a chance to not get damaged when used on smoothstone
- Leather and gold armor have more durability
- Add spruce, birch and jungle versions of some items / blocks
- Adjusted mob drops, like more leather, feathers and porkchops
- Chickens randomly drop feathers

I'll most likely make this run as a server-only mod, unless you use settings that require
the mod to be installed on the client. Though with the way Forge deals with Vanilla
clients, it's currently not possible to have them connect to a modded server.
