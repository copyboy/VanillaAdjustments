Vanilla Adjustments
===================

Hello there. You seem lost. Were you trying to find a place where you could find
information on this mod? Sorry about that, we're silly, just trying to have fun working
on this beautiful piece of art. Of course you're in the right place.

Feel free to contribute, just make sure that you talk to us (oitjustjose and copygirl)
first to make sure we want to accept the changes you're suggesting. The best way to
contact us is in [#obsidian on EsperNet](http://irc.esper.net/#obsidian). And don't
forget the most important thing of all: Your commit messages have to be silly, funny, or
failing to be so.


'Adjustments'
-------------

Since we're going for adjustments to the vanilla Minecraft game, we won't add new items.  

- Replaces cobblestone with smoothstone in most recipes
- Add reverse / back-crafting recipes for slabs and stairs
- Wood and stone tools straight-up have more durability
- Iron and diamond pickaxes have a chance not to use up durability when used on stone
- Leather and gold armor have more durability
- Add spruce, birch and jungle versions of some items / blocks
- Adjust mob drops, like more leather, feathers and porkchops
- Chickens randomly drop feathers

Fixes
-----

We try to fix small bugs, annoying or cosmetic issues that are in vanilla Minecraft.

- Can't right-click fences unless you're leading an animal
